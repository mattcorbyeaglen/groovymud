# groovymud
GroovyMud was a forey into the interactions between the Groovy language and Java. It is a fully-fledged mud, implemented (badly) - but it wasn't about being correct it was about learning the limitations of myself and the Groovy/Java language.

It probably doesn't even compile any more, but it was fun :)

# What is a MUD?

A MUD is short for Multi User Dungeon, and is (usually) text based. Users require a telnet connection to interact with the MUD, and issue text commands like `look`, `north`, `get foo from bar` etc.

For further information about what MUDs are try (here)[http://www.mudconnect.com/mud_intro.html] and for playable muds try (here)[http://www.topmudsites.com/].

# Why is it only one Git commit, what happened?

Originally the code was hosted somewhere that used subversion (I think it was googlecode). That site shut down a while ago, and to preserve my code I ported it here. There's also a rewrite I stared on 0.2, but that's not complete in any way.

# How can I run it?

I forget, I have no idea how to set it up again and no interest in documenting it here ;) Kudos if you can figure it out, and post instructions. The PR would be welcome.
